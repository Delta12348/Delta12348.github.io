           <p>The future is now. 
               <br><br>Education has always being the base to an efficient and organized society. Nontheless, the Education System has been evolving in an unnatural manner, resulting in an uneven education.
               <br><br>To mitigate this, my whole mission and vision is in the implementation of gamificated solutions which result attractive to learners, and tranform the learning process into a fun, efficient and effective manner.
               <br><br> To achieve this, I use a diversity of technological tools to facilitate this process. From the creation of multiple websites which can be accesed by anyone and anywhere, to the creation of gamificated activities using game engines to offer professional and powerful appications for a diversity of needs.
